# ElevateElement

## What Is ElevateElement?
ElevateElement is a lightweight, custom JavaScript framework built on top of native Web Components. It combines modern modular architecture with minimal runtime overhead, aiming to give developers a simple yet powerful way to build performant, maintainable, and future-proof front-end applications — without relying on heavyweight frameworks like React or Svelte.

### Core Philosophy
> "Closer to the metal, infinitely flexible, and fully yours."

ElevateElement emphasizes ownership, customizability, and performance, keeping your web stack aligned with native browser capabilities (no compile step, no virtual DOM).

## Benefits of ElevateElement

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| 🧱 **Modular features (mixins)** | Add only what you need (state, ajax, events, routing, etc.) |
| 🧩 **Web Component base** | Native browser support, encapsulation, zero dependencies |
| 🧠 **Custom lifecycle hooks** | Introspect + intercept logic at every stage |
| ⚙️ **Shadow DOM templating** | Clean separation of styles and structure |
| 🛠 **Manual + dynamic routing** | Supports SPA behavior with history or hash modes |
| 📡 **Channel messaging** | Enables tab-to-tab sync and app-level events |
| 📦 **Config loader** | Centralizes business config and branding per app |
| 🌐 **AI/Web3 extensibility** | Prepares framework for smart, decentralized features |
| 🧪 **Built-in testing dashboard** | Allows fast visual verification of each core feature |

## Current Capabilities (Already Built)

✅ ElevateElement core with lifecycle, state, event, ajax, styling, and templating  
✅ Modular architecture (mixins can be turned on/off)  
✅ Internal router with error fallback and prefetching  
✅ Navigation builder and responsive layout system  
✅ Channel messaging and cross-tab sync  
✅ Config loader with dev mode and client info  
✅ Test element suite for verifying all features  

## Development Roadmap

### 🧱 1. Finalize Core Components
- `<route-link>` functionality and accessibility (now fixed)
- Ensure all registered components (navigation, views, route-links) are upgraded properly
- Add `<slot>` support where needed (for real DOM projection)
- Finalize `<route-menu>` and multi-level navigation builder

### 🌐 2. Service Worker Integration
Add service worker support for:
- Offline access
- Caching pages and routes
- Versioning and update lifecycle

### 📋 3. Accessibility + SEO Helpers
- Enforce role, aria-*, lang, and keyboard nav in templates
- Integrate a lightweight `<seo-manager>` and `<a11y-helper>` class to apply this site-wide

### 🧭 4. Global Bootstrap & Builder
Create a central ElevateBuilder or elevateApp() that:
- Loads config
- Registers all core elements
- Binds views
- Initializes router and service worker
- Ensures components are upgraded before view loading

### 🧪 5. Testing & Final QA
- Verify that all test elements (Manual Event, AJAX, Channel, Error, Config) work independently and together
- Cross-browser test: Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari
- Mobile responsive layouts working as intended

### 🧼 6. Cleanup + Documentation
- Remove dev logs (or gate them behind a dev flag)
- Write usage documentation for:
  - Creating a component
  - Routing setup
  - Layout system
  - Adding new features

## Version 1 Goal
A complete, documented, and modular native JavaScript framework capable of powering fully functional SPAs — built entirely on Web Components with optional progressive features.

## Future Roadmap (v1.1-1.5)

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Web3 Wallet Support | Connect to MetaMask or WalletConnect |
| WASM Bridge | Run high-performance logic in Rust/Assembly |
| AI Integration | Build AI-assisted elements (text completion, smart forms) |
| CLI Tool (Optional) | elevate new, elevate build for scaffolding and bundling |
| Design Tokens | Style system for themes and branding |

## Final Thought
ElevateElement is about creating a platform that's:

- Lightweight
- Native
- Extensible
- Truly yours

You're not just building a framework — you're crafting a new standard for ownership and web intelligence.
